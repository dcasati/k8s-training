## Target Audience

The target audience for this tutorial is someone that is looking for an end-to-end hands-on experience for deploying an application into a Kubernetes cluster.

## Solution Details

1. Provision Azure SQL.
1. Provision Azure Container Registry (ACR) or Docker Hub.
1. Setup the registry in the K8S cluster.
1. Push the containers into the registry.
1. BuildÂ  & Deploy the application.

## Prerequisites

For these exercises, you will need:

* A Github account
* An Azure account
* A Visual Studio for Teams (VSTS) account at visualstudio.com

This tutorial assumes you have access to a Kubernetes Cluster. The examples here will use [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). For more information please refer to the [Before You Begin](sections/01-before-you-begin.md) section.

While Azure is used for basic infrastructure requirements the lessons learned in this tutorial can be applied to other platforms.
