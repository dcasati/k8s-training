# Cleaning up

Now that we are done, we can clean up our environment with the following:

## Procedure

```bash
az group delete --name $resourcegroupname
```

> NOTE: If you wish to keep parts of the deployment, the easiest way is to delete only the parts that you are not interested through the web portal at [portal.azure.com.](portal.azure.com)
